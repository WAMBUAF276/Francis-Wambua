          I am an Actuarial Science graduate and data enthusiast with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics,
          and financial risk management. My career focus lies at the intersection of actuarial modeling, data analytics,
          and business intelligence—using quantitative insight to drive informed decision-making in finance, insurance,
          and investment management.

    <!-- About -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a strategic and analytical professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science and hands-on
        experience in customer service, financial reporting, and data-driven analysis. My unique strength lies in bridging
        technical precision with client-centered solutions. I understand that actuarial work is not just about numbers—it’s about
        managing uncertainty and communicating complex insights in a way that empowers organizations to make confident, data-informed decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my journey at Faida Investment Bank, The Actuarial Society of Kenya (TASK), and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC),
        I developed practical skills in CRM systems, Excel-based forecasting, regulatory reporting, and large-scale data management.
        My responsibilities ranged from actuarial support to client relationship management, exposing me to real-world applications of analytical modeling and compliance frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a growing interest in applying actuarial techniques to emerging areas such as data science, machine learning, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk modeling.
        I continually invest in professional development through industry certifications, actuarial workshops, and technical skill-building in tools like Python, R, and SQL.

    <!-- Professional Goals -->
    <section id="goals">
      <h2>Professional Interests & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        As an aspiring actuary, my long-term goal is to qualify as a Fellow of a recognized actuarial body (such as the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries or the Society of Actuaries)
        and specialize in financial risk management, data science applications, and predictive modeling for insurance and investment sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in exploring how actuarial science can integrate with data analytics to develop predictive frameworks for 
        claims management, pension forecasting, credit risk assessment, and sustainability modeling. I aim to contribute to organizations 
        that use quantitative insight to drive ethical, efficient, and innovative financial decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the near term, I seek to join a data-driven financial institution or consulting firm where I can apply statistical techniques, actuarial models, and 
        analytical programming to solve real-world challenges, while continuing professional actuarial exams and building industry specialization.
